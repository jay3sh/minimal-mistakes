<p>
  A majority of our vector art is inspired from the real life images. A vector
  art is an abstract view of the reality. A view that can mimic or mock the
  original. In any case the inspiration comes from a bitmap image. We want to
  draw abstract, crisp images using our vector drawing tools. Our vector
  illustrations are meant to mimic or mock the real images on which they are
  based on. But in any case we start from a reference bitmap image.
  We get a JPEG from a client or pull an image from Google image search or just
  snap a photowith our phone. We import it into our vector graphics tool and
  start to trace it. The process can take hours depending upon how much detail
  you want to capture.

  <strong>Zector Trace</strong> focuses on this aspect of Vector Graphics
  design and offers an interface that speeds up this workflow immensely.
