<h1>Zector Trace</h1>

<p>
  Majority of vector art is inspired from the real life images. A vector
  art is an abstract view of the reality. A view that can mimic or mock the
  original.
</p>
<p>
  Naturally the inspiration for a vector illustration comes from a bitmap image.
  We get a JPEG from a client or pull an image from Google image search or just
  snap a photo with our phone and import it into our vector graphics tool as a
  reference background image. Then we start tracing the curves and filling the
  shapes. The process can take from few minutes to several hours depending upon how much
  detail you want to capture.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately the existing Vector Graphics tools don't provide
  any help to make the artist's life easy in this process, even though this
  workflow involves so many repetitive tasks.
  <strong>Zector Trace</strong> addresses this exact problem. It was conceived
  from the frustration that its developer felt while creating a Vector portrait
  by tracing the head-shot of a model. <strong>Trace</strong> was designed by
  identifying all the things that the software can do automatically once it
  has assumed this workflow. This makes the process very fast and definitely
  more enjoyable for the artist. <strong>Trace</strong> offers a minimal yet
  very responsive user interface that is extremely intuitive.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Trace</strong> is in late stage of development and it will soon be
  available to early users. If you want to be the first one to try...
